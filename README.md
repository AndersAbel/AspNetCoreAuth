# Asp.Net Core Authentication Authorization

This is a demo app that I created for a conference talk about Asp.Net Core Authentication and Authorization.
It can be used to play around with or show what the different methods of the authentication API does to
different handlers.

## Main Branch - runnable
The main branch contains a complete runnable solution. But you have to update the certificate thumbprint
for data protection to one availabel on your system.

## TalkStart Branch
The TalkStart branch contains a version that can be started, but doesn't work completely. The critical/interesting
parts are removed with the intention to show how to add them during the talk.
